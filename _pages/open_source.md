In my free time, I try to contribute to open source software; my GitHub username is [@codetalker7](https://github.com/codetalker7){:target="\_blank"}. On this page I'll try to describe various contributions I've made!


## The Julia Language

I was part of 2022 edition of [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/){:target="\_blank"}, where I was selected as a contributor for [The Julia Language](https://julialang.org/jsoc/){:target="\_blank"}. My project was to [make improvements to the CRRao.jl package](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2022/projects/wbPGeN3c){:target="\_blank"}. I made a [final report](https://github.com/xKDR/GSoC/blob/main/2022/CRRao.jl/siddhant_chaudhary_final.md){:target="\_blank"} for the same.

Apart from this, I've contributed to the following Julia packages as well.
- [Lowess.jl](https://github.com/xKDR/Lowess.jl){:target="\_blank"}, which is a pure Julia implementation of the LOWESS smoother.
- [NighttimeLights.jl](https://github.com/xKDR/NighttimeLights.jl){:target="\_blank"}, which is a package to analyze satellite data. We also worked with [Rasters.jl](https://rafaqz.github.io/Rasters.jl/dev/){:target="\_blank"}.
- [TSFrames.jl](https://github.com/xKDR/TSx.jl){:target="\_blank"}, a package for Timeseries in Julia.
- [Survey.jl](https://github.com/xKDR/Survey.jl){:target="\_blank"}, a package for complex survey analysis in Julia.

All of this work has been possible because of the help I got from people at the [xKDR](https://www.xkdr.org/){:target="\_blank"} organization.

## The Document Foundation

I've also [contributed](https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/index.php?title=Development/Developers&oldid=493481){:target="\_blank"} to the [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/){:target="\_blank"} suite. My work mainly revolved around tinkering with LO's UI, using tools like [gtk](https://www.gtk.org/){:target="\_blank"} and [Glade](https://glade.gnome.org/){:target="\_blank"}, along with working with LO's registry; for example, here are two of my patches.
- A patch for the [Paste Special Dialogue](https://git.libreoffice.org/core/+/9d0ca8ee3f0c2a4e6c0bebec6ef1523cd04e849a%5E%21){:target="\_blank"}
- A patch for the [open-locked query box](https://git.libreoffice.org/core/+/ff9ff6018bea7c1a4524c8edca8ef554c74e4b3f%5E%21){:target="\_blank"}.

LO has one of the best workflows I've encountered thus far. They use [Gerrit](https://www.gerritcodereview.com/){:target="\_blank"} for code review and [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/){:target="\_blank"} for CI, along with a bunch of other tools which they have embedded in their codebase.

> ##### Get Involved!

> If you want to contribute to OSS and like C++, LO might be a great choice to get started. LO's core developers very actively look for new contributors, and are always available to help. It's not hard to [get involved](https://www.libreoffice.org/community/get-involved/){:target="\_blank"}.
