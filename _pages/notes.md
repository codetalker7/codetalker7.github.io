This page contains links to a bunch of notes that I have maintained while attending various courses, and notes for some talks and reading projects. I use these mainly for my own reference. Some of them may not be complete, and errors are abound! In any set of notes, I have tried to write the most interesting and the most important parts as I understand them.
