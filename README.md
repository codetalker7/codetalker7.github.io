Welcome to my homepage! I am a student at the [Chennai Mathematical Institute](https://www.cmi.ac.in/), a research insitute based in Chennai, India. I am a passionate problem solver, and I also love to write code. You can find a lot of what I do on this site.

Broadly speaking, my interests lie in Computer Science. I like anything that revolves around algorithms, theoretical machine learning, optimization and programming languages. In math, I'm mainly interested in algebra, topology and probability theory.

In my free time, I love contributing to open source software, and speed type ([this](https://data.typeracer.com/pit/profile?user=code_talker) is my last TypeRacer profile, which I've abandoned. I'm currently using [this](https://data.typeracer.com/pit/profile?user=professor_pyg) one). I used to participate in programming contest on various platforms, and I maintained a [repository](https://github.com/codetalker7/cp-res) of some of my CP code.

This website is updated whenever I have something new to add, which most likely is at the end of a semester. My contact information is available below. I would love to talk about math/computer science/open source software. A copy of my resume is available on request.
