Welcome to my homepage! I am a student at the [Chennai Mathematical Institute](https://www.cmi.ac.in/){:target="\_blank"}, a research insitute based in Chennai, India. I am a passionate problem solver, and I also love to write code. You can find a lot of what I do on this site.

Broadly speaking, my interests lie in Computer Science. I like anything that revolves around algorithms, theoretical machine learning, optimization and programming languages (check out my [research work](/pages/research){:target="\_blank"}). In math, I'm mainly interested in algebra, topology and probability theory.

In my free time, I love contributing to open source software. Check out some of my open source contributions [here](/pages/code){:target="\_blank"}. I also love speed typing ([this](https://data.typeracer.com/pit/profile?user=code_talker){:target="\_blank"} is my last TypeRacer profile, which I've abandoned. I'm currently using [this](https://data.typeracer.com/pit/profile?user=professor_pyg){:target="\_blank"} one).

This website is updated whenever I have something new to add (check the bottom of this page for major updates), which most likely is at the end of a semester. My contact information is available below. I would love to talk about math/computer science/open source software. A copy of my resume is available on request.

> This webpage was made using [Jekyll's Gitbook](https://sighingnow.github.io/jekyll-gitbook/){:target="\_blank"} theme. I was using my own template in the old website, which I had been wanting to change for a while. The old website still lives in the `main` branch of the `codetalker7.github.io` repository.
