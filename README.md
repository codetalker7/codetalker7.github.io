Welcome to my homepage! I am a passionate problem solver, and I also love to write code. You can find a lot of what I do on this site.

As part of the [Laboratory for Computational Social Systems (LCS2) @IIT Delhi](https://www.lcs2.in/people_restructured.html){:target="\_blank"} (led by [Dr. Tanmoy Chakraborty](https://tanmoychak.com/){:target="\_blank"}) as a research assistant, I'm currently working on problems revolving around *large language models* (LLMs), particularly problems on model and inference efficiency, and fact-discovery capabilities of LLMs. 

During my masters ([@CMI](https://www.cmi.ac.in/){:target="\_blank"}), I also worked as a research assistant at the [Networks and Learning Group at TIFR Mumbai](https://abhishek-sinha-tifr.github.io/group.html){:target="\_blank"} (led by [Dr. Abhishek Sinha](https://abhishek-sinha-tifr.github.io/){:target="\_blank"}), wherein I worked on problems in the intersection of learning theory, convex optimization and online algorithms. This work involved designing provably optimal online policies for many problems arising frequently in ML domains: the online subset selection problem, for which we introduced an efficient online policy (which is also the first of it's kind to incorporate *hints* in learning optimal subsets), the contextual bandits problem with a new concave $\alpha$-fairness objective, for which we developed the first such policy in the bandit information setup, and problems in the domain of online meta-learning and multi-task learning. Check out my [research work](/pages/research){:target="\_blank"}.

I'm also interested in applied areas of ML, including deep learning, natural language processing (particularly LLMs) and automatic differentation (in particular, source to source AD. Art like [Zygote.jl](https://github.com/FluxML/Zygote.jl){:target="\_blank"}). I also like to learn about programming languages and the ecosystem of toolchains surrounding them. In math, I'm mainly interested in algebra, topology and probability theory.

In my free time, I love contributing to and exploring open source software, and write about OSS and linux. Check out some of my open source contributions on my [GitHub profile(@codetalker7)](https://github.com/codetalker7){:target="\_blank"} or [here](/pages/open_source){:target="\_blank"}. I've also described my [configuration](/pages/code){:target="\_blank"} and written some blogs on various topics (including OSS, set-ups and linux; you can see them on the navigation pane on the left). I also love speed typing ([this](https://data.typeracer.com/pit/profile?user=code_talker){:target="\_blank"} is my last TypeRacer profile, which I've abandoned. I'm currently using [this](https://data.typeracer.com/pit/profile?user=professor_pyg){:target="\_blank"} one). I'm also a huge NBA fan, and I love listening to and playing metal music (one of my favorite bands is [Periphery](https://periphery.net/){:target="\_blank"})!

This website is updated whenever I have something new to add (check the bottom of this page for major updates). My contact information is available below. I would love to talk about math/computer science/open source software. A copy of my resume is available on request.
