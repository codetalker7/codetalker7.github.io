Hello! I'm an upcoming CS PhD student at the
[Kahlert School of Computing, University of Utah](https://www.cs.utah.edu/). On
this website, you'll find a lot of information about my work and interests.

Currently, I'm interested in building the theoretical foundations of _large
language models_ (LLMs). This includes all aspects of the inner workings of
these models , ranging from their ability to retain long-term information
(memory), their reasoning capabilities (eg., _in-context learning_) and making
them more efficient (_model compression_). I'm also interested in other general
problems in theoretical machine learning, pertaining to areas like
high-dimensional statistics, online/statistical learning, and privacy-related
problems in these areas.

## Previous work and affiliations

As part of the
[Laboratory for Computational Social Systems (LCS2) @IIT Delhi](https://www.lcs2.in/people_restructured.html){:target="\_blank"}
(led by [Dr. Tanmoy Chakraborty](https://tanmoychak.com/){:target="\_blank"}), I
previously worked as a research assistant on problems revolving around LLMs,
particularly problems on model and inference efficiency. During this time, we
developed a novel, calibration-free model pruning technique; we studied scaling
laws for model pruning, and we also developed a new technique for compressing KV
caches during the inference phase of LLMs.

During my masters ([@CMI](https://www.cmi.ac.in/){:target="\_blank"}), I also
worked as a research assistant at the
[Networks and Learning Group at TIFR Mumbai](https://abhishek-sinha-tifr.github.io/group.html){:target="\_blank"}
(led by
[Dr. Abhishek Sinha](https://abhishek-sinha-tifr.github.io/){:target="\_blank"}),
wherein I worked on problems in the intersection of learning theory, convex
optimization and online algorithms. This work involved designing provably
optimal online policies for many problems arising frequently in ML domains: the
online subset selection problem, for which we introduced an efficient online
policy (which is also the first of it's kind to incorporate _hints_ in learning
optimal subsets), the contextual bandits problem with a new concave
$\alpha$-fairness objective, for which we developed the first such policy in the
bandit information setup, and problems in the domain of online meta-learning and
multi-task learning. I try to update my
[research work on this website](/pages/research){:target="\_blank"}, but it can
also be found on my
[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WZ9a08wAAAAJ&hl=en).

## Open source and writing

I also love contributing to and exploring open source software. My contributions
can be found on my
[GitHub profile(@codetalker7)](https://github.com/codetalker7){:target="\_blank"}
or
[here (but this page could be outdated)](/pages/open_source){:target="\_blank"}.
I've also described my [configuration](/pages/code){:target="\_blank"} (though
some parts of it could be a bit old). I used to speed type
([this](https://data.typeracer.com/pit/profile?user=code_talker){:target="\_blank"}
is my last TypeRacer profile, which I've abandoned. I'm currently using
[this](https://data.typeracer.com/pit/profile?user=professor_pyg){:target="\_blank"}
one). I'm also a huge NBA fan, and I love listening to and playing metal music
(one of my favorite bands is
[Periphery](https://periphery.net/){:target="\_blank"})!

Occasionally, I write about random things (mostly related to tech, theory or
OSS). You can find all of my blogs on the navigation bar on the left.
